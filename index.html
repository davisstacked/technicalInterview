  <h4>var, let, and const</h4>

  <p>Var is function scoped. let and const are block scope. Block scope means anything with curly braces let and const can't escape to higher scope. so if statements, loops, anything with curly braces </p> 
  <p>Var causes security risks and it can cause confusion </p>


  <h4>Object oriented vs functional programming</h4>
<h5>Functional Programming</h5>
  <p>the most important concept in functional programming is the concept of Pure Functions. This means the output of your function should only depend on its inputs.</p>
  <p>We can make it an inpure function by manipulating the numbers directly. This produces a side effect and functional code should produce no side effects.</p>
  <p>another core part of immutable data is that it is stateless - when data is created it is never mutated.</p>

  <ul>
    Functional Programming 
    <li>Pure Functions</li>
    <li>Immutable Data. Stateless - when data is created it is never mutated. Wouldn't call .push() or anything like that.</li>
    <li>Functions as arguments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Object oriented</h5>
  <p>Object oriented, or imperative, gives you a clear set of directions to follow to get a cake from recipe to final state. Where as functional programming, declarative, explains the state and logic involved but has no opinion on the actual control flow.</p>

  <p>Inheritance vs. Composition for code reusability. <br>
    with INHERITANCE you start with a larger base class then have child classes inherit all of this functionality and override or extend it with whatever functionality they need <br>
    with COMPOSITION breaks apart the interfaces and logic into a lot of small pieces then builds up larger functions or objects by combining these pieces together.
